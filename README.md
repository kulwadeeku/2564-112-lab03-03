Given a client program `RightTriangleClient.java` under the directory `src`.
 Implement a `RightTriangle` class that is used by the `RightTriangleClient` program. 
 Your `RightTriangle` class should consists of the following attributes and methods.
 
 * a `private` `double` attribute, named `base` for storing the value of the triangle's base.
 * a `private` `double` attribute, named `height` for storing the value of the triangle's height. 
 * an `accessor` method, named `getBase()` that returns the size of the triangle's base.
 * an `accessor` method, named `getHeight()` that returns the size of the triangle's height.
 * a `public` method, named `calcHypotenuse()` that returns the size of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
 * a `public` method, named `calcArea()` that returns the area of the right triangle.
 
*Note* DO NOT CHANGE the content of the client program `RightTriangleClient.java`.!!!
